        <p>Social and physical distancing measures aim to slow the spread of disease by stopping chains</p>

        <p>These measures secure physical distance between people (of at least one metre), and reduce </p>

        <h4>Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Following are some of the frequently asked questions:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>What is COVID-19?</li>
            <br>
            <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</p>
            <br>
            <li>What is community spread?</li>
            <br>
            <p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your local health department’s website.</p>
            <br>
            <li>What are the symptoms and other complications that COVID-19 can cause?</li>
            <br>
            <p>People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Is at-home specimen collection or testing available?</li>
            <br>
            <p>Yes. At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen at home and either send it to a testing facility or preform the test at home.
                You and your healthcare provider might consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or if you can’t get testing at a local healthcare facility.</p>
                <br>
                <li>Is online registration mandatory for COVID-19 vaccination?</li>
                <br>
                <p>No, vaccination centers provide for a limited number of on-spot registration slots every day. Beneficiaries can register online or walk-in to vaccination centers where the vaccination team staff can register a beneficiary. In general, all beneficiaries are recommended to register online and schedule vaccination in advance for a hassle-free vaccination experience.</p>
